# Heart Disease Prediction Model
## Predicting Heart Disease Presence Using Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset

### Introduction
Heart disease is the second leading cause of mortality in Canada, with 14 Canadian adults (aged 20 and over) diagnosed with heart disease dying every hour, according to the CCDSS. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to perform binary classification of heart disease presence using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. Our goal is to develop a model that provides rapid and accurate heart disease diagnoses, which can alleviate the workload of physicians and improve the quality of life for both patients and healthcare professionals.

### Outcomes and Significance
With this prediction model, we can use existing data to predict future heart disease diagnoses, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing errors in manual diagnoses. This model, relying on real-world case comparisons, has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling rapid, automated diagnoses. However, the limited number of features in the dataset poses questions about the model's accuracy. Further research is needed to identify additional features that may influence heart disease, which could improve the model's predictive capabilities.

### Technologies Used
Programming Language: R 

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN)

Libraries: 
- tidyverse: for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization
  - dplyr for data wrangling
  - ggplot2 for data visualization
- caret: for model training, cross-validation, and performance evaluation
- class: for implementing the k-NN algorithm
- pROC: for generating and visualizing ROC curves to evaluate model performance
